# 🚀 C++ Exercises - Level 2 (Advanced Foundations) 🛠️

A collection of **43 unique and challenging C++ programming problems**, each solved from scratch and housed in its own dedicated folder. This repository marks my progression into more advanced and complex concepts in C++.

---

## 🎯 Repository Overview

This repository represents the **second level** of my C++ skill development journey. It serves as a direct continuation of the foundations built in the Level 1 repository:

➡️ **[C++ Exercises - Level 1](https://github.com/MohamedRaghebOmer/Cpp-Exercises-level-1)**

While Level 1 focused on fundamental syntax, basic logic, and control structures, **Level 2** delves into intermediate to early-advanced topics, ensuring a strong understanding of C++'s deeper features.

## 💡 What's Inside?

The 43 exercises in this repository cover a wide spectrum of concepts, ensuring **no repetitive ideas**. The problems are designed to push logical thinking and practical application of C++ features.

| Concept Area | Focus | Examples (Covered in the 43 problems) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Structuring** | `enum`, `struct`, `union` | Structuring complex data, type safety with enums, memory management. |
| **Control Flow & Logic** | **Recursion**, Advanced Loops | Solving problems via recursive function calls, complex iterative algorithms. |
| **Functional Paradigm** | Function Pointers, `std::function`, **Lambdas** | Passing functions as arguments, defining anonymous functions for utility. |
| **Memory Management** | Pointers, Dynamic Allocation (`new`/`delete`) | Working directly with memory addresses, managing heap memory. |
| **String & File Handling** | Advanced `std::string` manipulation, I/O streams | File reading/writing (e.g., CSV parsing), advanced string algorithms. |

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem is contained within a separate folder, numbered sequentially from **01 to 43**.
```
Problem-XX/
├── main.cpp
```

* **Each folder** contains a single `main.cpp` file with the complete solution.
* **The entire solution** for every problem was implemented **independently and from scratch** by me, **Mohamed Ragheb Omer**.

## 💻 How to Run the Solutions

To compile and run any exercise, navigate to its folder in your terminal and use a standard C++ compiler (like GCC or Clang):

1.  **Navigate:**
    ```bash
    cd 0X_Problem_Name
    ```
2.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o program
    ```
3.  **Execute:**
    ```bash
    ./program
    ```
